**User requests:**
Build me an application in python that keeps score of a live baseball game. After each pitch of the game the corresponding icon is pressed to tally the action from the last play. Utilize a baseball diamond visual representation of the current situation of the game with runners highlighted at correct bases as a display. The application will categorize and store all game data over multiple seasons and display it into an easy to view modern metrics display of stats with interchangeable timelines and cross stats.

### Project Plan for Baseball Scorekeeping Application

#### **1. Project Overview**
The goal is to develop a Python-based baseball scorekeeping application that tracks live game scores, updates the game state dynamically, and provides a user-friendly interface for logging plays and viewing statistics. The application will include a visual representation of the baseball diamond, real-time updates, and long-term data storage for historical analysis.

#### **2. Main Tasks**

**Task 1: Define Core Functionality**
- **Subtask 1.1**: Design the game state logic (e.g., strikes, balls, hits, outs, runs).
- **Subtask 1.2**: Implement pitch-by-pitch updates based on user input.
- **Subtask 1.3**: Develop logic to handle base runners and scoring.

**Task 2: Design the Visual Interface**
- **Subtask 2.1**: Create a baseball diamond visualization with dynamic updates.
- **Subtask 2.2**: Design a user-friendly GUI for logging plays (e.g., buttons for strikes, balls, hits, etc.).
- **Subtask 2.3**: Display live game stats (e.g., score, inning, outs).

**Task 3: Implement Data Storage**
- **Subtask 3.1**: Design a database schema for storing game data (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).
- **Subtask 3.2**: Implement data storage for pitch-by-pitch details, runs, hits, and errors.
- **Subtask 3.3**: Develop functions to retrieve and update game data.

**Task 4: Metrics and Statistics Display**
- **Subtask 4.1**: Design a stats dashboard for viewing game and season statistics.
- **Subtask 4.2**: Implement interchangeable timelines (e.g., per game, per season).
- **Subtask 4.3**: Add cross-stats functionality (e.g., player vs. team, team vs. team).

**Task 5: Testing and Optimization**
- **Subtask 5.1**: Test core functionality (e.g., pitch logging, diamond updates).
- **Subtask 5.2**: Optimize for performance and responsiveness.
- **Subtask 5.3**: Conduct user testing for the GUI and overall usability.

**Task 6: Documentation and Deployment**
- **Subtask 6.1**: Write user documentation for logging plays and viewing stats.
- **Subtask 6.2**: Prepare developer documentation for future updates.
- **Subtask 6.3**: Package and deploy the application.

#### **3. Technical Considerations**

**Backend Logic**:
- Use Python for core game logic and data processing.
- Libraries: `pandas` for data manipulation, `sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy` for database interactions.

**Frontend GUI**:
- Use a Python GUI framework like `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for desktop applications.
- Alternatively, use a web-based framework like `Flask` or `Django` with a frontend library like `React` for a more modern interface.

**Data Storage**:
- Use SQLite for lightweight, local storage or PostgreSQL for scalability.
- Alternatively, use file-based storage (e.g., JSON or CSV) for simplicity.

**Visualization**:
- Use `matplotlib` or `plotly` for generating statistical charts.
- For the baseball diamond, use a canvas widget in `Tkinter` or `PyQt`, or a web-based SVG/Canvas solution.

**Performance**:
- Optimize database queries and data structures for real-time updates.
- Ensure the GUI is responsive and lightweight.

#### **4. Timeline**

| **Phase**               | **Tasks**                                                                 | **Duration** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Phase 1: Planning**    | Finalize requirements, choose libraries, and design database schema.      | 1 week       |
| **Phase 2: Core Logic**  | Implement game state logic, pitch logging, and base runner updates.       | 2 weeks      |
| **Phase 3: GUI Design**  | Develop the baseball diamond visualization and play-logging interface.    | 2 weeks      |
| **Phase 4: Data Storage**| Implement database or file-based storage for game data.                   | 1 week       |
| **Phase 5: Stats Display**| Build the stats dashboard and implement timelines/cross-stats.            | 2 weeks      |
| **Phase 6: Testing**     | Test functionality, optimize performance, and conduct user testing.       | 1 week       |
| **Phase 7: Deployment**  | Package the application, write documentation, and deploy.                 | 1 week       |

#### **5. Deliverables**
1. **Prototype**: Core functionality with a basic GUI for logging plays and updating the diamond.
2. **Final Application**: Fully functional application with data storage, stats visualization, and a polished GUI.
3. **Documentation**: User and developer documentation.
4. **Deployment Package**: Executable or web-based application ready for use.

---

#### **6. Risks and Mitigation**
- **Risk**: Performance issues with real-time updates.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize database queries and use efficient data structures.
- **Risk**: Complex GUI design.
  - **Mitigation**: Use a modular approach and test with users early.
- **Risk**: Scalability of data storage.
  - **Mitigation**: Use a scalable database like PostgreSQL and design a robust schema.
