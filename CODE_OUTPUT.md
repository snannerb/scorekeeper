### **How to Run the Application**

1. **Create the Project Directory**:
   - Create a directory named `baseball_scorekeeper`.

2. **Save the Code**:
   - Save the above code in a file named `main.py` inside the `baseball_scorekeeper` directory.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the `baseball_scorekeeper` directory.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

4. **Expected Output**:
   - The application will initialize the database (`baseball_game.db`) if it doesn't exist.
   - It will log a series of events (strikes, balls, hits) and print the game state after each event.
   - The events will also be stored in the SQLite database.

---

### **Database File**
- The SQLite database file (`baseball_game.db`) will be created automatically in the same directory as `main.py`.
- You can use a SQLite browser (e.g., [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)) to inspect the `game_log` table and its contents.

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **GUI Development**:
   - Use `Tkinter` or `PyQt` to create a user-friendly interface for logging plays and displaying the game state.

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Implement functions to query the database and display game/season statistics.

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the `GameState` class and database interactions.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Package the application into an executable or deploy it as a web app.
